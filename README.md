# Drive-Drowsiness-Detector
Driver drowsiness detection is a project built using Dlib and OpenCV with Python as a backend language.

# Logic of project-
The project includes direct working with the 68 facial landmark detector and also the face detector of the Dlib library. The 68 facial landmark detector is a robustly trained efficient detector which detects the points on the human face using which we determine whether the eyes are open or they are closed.
